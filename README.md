# Password Generator Starter Code

## Description

The goal of this assignment was to create a password generator that display different password anytime the "generate password" button is clicked. The password length should be anywhere from 8-128 digits with upper case leters, lower case letters and special characters. In order to accomplish this assignement, I started by cloning the starter code given in the assignemnt. I declared all the variables at the begining of my script.js file. I also created a generate password function with prompts for each variable. I also used conat() to add criterias to an empty array. 
In this assignment, I was able to practice the use of variables and functions. I also learned the difference btween prompt and confirm().
